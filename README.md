### Development Highlights

* **Test First** – This project was written predominantly with a test-first approach. Write a failing test, write minimal code to make that test pass, and then do any desired refactorings because the tests provide confidence.
* **Functional Core, Imperative Shell** – Keep the parts on the "inside" of the program as pure and immutable as possible and only use impure, side-effecting procedures at the "boundaries".

* **Live Coding** – At least part of this project was streamed on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rainocodes) with archives uploaded to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx02LJT0RTblmsGnDoNGxKw).
